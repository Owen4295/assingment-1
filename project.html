    <h2>Python Code That Counts the Amount of Words in a TXT File</h2>

    <p>This was one of my assignments from last year in my Object-Oriented Programming class. The task was to create a Python class called WordCounter that reads a text file, processes the words, and finds the top 10 most frequent ones.</p>

    <h2>Simple Calculator Coded with Python</h2>

    <p>This was one of my assignments from my Intro to Programming class that I took last year. The task was to create a simple mathematical calculator. The code allows the user to perform basic math operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. It continuously prompts the user to choose an operator until they type "exit" or "stop."</p>
